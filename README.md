## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything specifically, but it took me a minute to get the image's size right. It took a bit of trial and error because I don't have that sharp eye with dimensions yet.

### Continued development

If there was something I had to work on, I would say css variables and font-sizes. This specific challenge had hard-coded font-sizes, but if it wasn't for the style guide, I'd be completely lost on what css variables I need.
